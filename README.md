Welcome to Viral Pandemonium. This web application was created by Ameya Mellacheruvu and Ona Igbinedion. This is a game where you play as a virus trying to not get eaten by the white blood cells around you. You can set up a decoy to ensure that  We were inspired by the legend that came before us, K'Tah as well as Professor Toal getting sick at the offset of this game's creation. The link is "https://peaceful-badlands-86358.herokuapp.com/ ". Have fun playing. Please note that it appears that we have uneven commits, but we worked evenly on this project.
